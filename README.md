Social Media Exploratory Data Analytics

This is the repository for SMEDA, a library for Social Media Exploratory Data Analtyics in Excel, which includes macros for scraping Twitter and for the rapid exploratory data analysis of the content retrieved.

Installation Instructions:
Import SMEDA.bas into Excel (Windows Version 2010-up)

Operational Instructions: http://www.professorf.com/SMEDA

For those that do not want to import the source code into Excel, I have included:

1-an Excel spreadsheet with SMEDA.bas already imported: SMEDA_V1_0.xlsm
2-A copy of the free-version of NodeXL:NodeXLGraph11.xlsx

NOTE: YOU MUST STILL OBTAIN A CONSUMER KEY AND CONSUMER SECRET FROM APPS.TWITTER.COM TO RUN SMEDA.  See operational instructions above.
